<h3>Twitter sentiment analysis</h3>
<div>Free and Open-sourced</div>
</div>

<p>SmmMobile is a Real-Time, Twitter Sentiment Analyzer tool, based on Naive Bayes classifier as demonstrated on <a href="http://smm.streamcrab.com">smm.streamcrab.com</a> </p>
<p>It tries to determine the attitude (Positve or Negative) of writer with respect to some topic or the overall tonality of a document</p>
<p>
<b>How it works</b>
</p>

<p>Every Tweet is analyzed for presence or absence of particular word/combination of words against training Dataset, 
that gives as a probability that a given text is positive or negative. Then all the probabilities combined together 
in order to calculate the overal tonality of Twitter chatter with respect to given topic or subject
</p>

<p>Limitations</p>
<p>- Each query is limited to 50 pulls, thats about 5000 Tweets.<br>
- Each IP is limited to 200 pulls / hour </p>


<p>If you need more than above specified limits, consider deploying your own Classifier Server or <a href="http://smm.streamcrab.com/contact">contact me</a></p>
